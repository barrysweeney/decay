# Nuclear Decay Simulation using JavaScript with Chart.js 
The purpose of this project is to visualize the decay of radioactive nucleons as a function of both time and the decay probability. 
# Getting Started
A few options are available to get up and running with the simulations:
* Index page available [here](https://barrysweeney.github.io/decay/) 
* Clone the repo: <code>git clone https://github.com/barrysweeney/decay.git</code>
# Prerequisites
* Code editor such as VSCode recommended. It can be downloaded from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Git - see install guide [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* The Odin Project has a guide for configuring Git and Github [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/setting-up-git)
# Built With
* Decay plots using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
* Compiled CSS from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
